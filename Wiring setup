 Wiring Setup Guide
 🔌 1. Power Rails
Connect 3.3V (Pin 1)** on the Pi to the **+ rail** on the breadboard.
Connect GND (Pin 6)** on the Pi to the **– rail** on the breadboard.

 2. LEDs (x4)
Each LED needs:
- One **220Ω resistor** on the cathode (short leg) to GND
- Anode (long leg) to a GPIO pin

| LED Color | GPIO Pin | Pi Pin # |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Red       | GPIO 5   | Pin 29   |
| Green     | GPIO 6   | Pin 31   |
| Blue      | GPIO 13  | Pin 33   |

**Wiring Steps:**
1. Insert LED into breadboard.
2. Connect **short leg** to GND rail through a 220Ω resistor.
3. Connect **long leg** to the assigned GPIO pin using a jumper wire.

### 🔘 3. Push Buttons (x4)
Each button needs:
- One side to **GND**
- The other side to a **GPIO pin** with an internal pull-down resistor enabled in code

| Button # | GPIO Pin | Pi Pin # |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1       | GPIO 27  | Pin 13   |
| 2        | GPIO 22  | Pin 15   |
| 3        | GPIO 10  | Pin 19   |

**Wiring Steps:**
1. Place button across the breadboard trench (straddling the gap).
2. Connect one leg to GND rail.
3. Connect the opposite leg to the assigned GPIO pin.

### 📏 4. HC-SR04 Distance Sensor
| Sensor Pin | Connect To | Pi Pin # |
|------------|------------|----------|
| VCC        | 5V         | Pin 2    |
| GND        | GND        | Pin 6    |
| TRIG       | GPIO 23    | Pin 16   |
| ECHO       | GPIO 24    | Pin 18   |

**Wiring Steps:**
1. Connect VCC to 5V power.
2. Connect GND to ground.
3. Connect TRIG to GPIO 23.
4. Connect ECHO to GPIO 24.
